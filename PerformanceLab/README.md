# Performance Lab

This repository contains the solution for the Performance Lab of a computer organization class. The Performance Lab is an exercise in which the goal is to analyze and evaluate the performance of different computer systems.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Performance Lab is to give students a deeper understanding of how different components of a computer system affect its performance. Through the lab, students will learn how to use different tools and techniques to measure and analyze the performance of a computer system, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and I/O throughput. The lab will also provide students with hands-on experience with different performance optimization techniques, such as caching, pipelining, and parallel processing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the performance lab directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the lab manual to set up and configure the test environment.
3. Use the provided tools and software to collect and analyze performance data.
4. Use the provided test cases to evaluate the performance of different computer systems.
5. Write a report on the results and observations from the lab.

## Tools and Resources

- Performance monitoring tools (e.g. perf, top, iostat)
- Profiling tools (e.g. gprof,valgrind)
- Benchmarking tools (e.g. sysbench, SPEC)
- Data analysis and visualization tools (e.g. R, Excel)
- Scripting languages (e.g. Python, Bash)

## Note

- The solution is provided for educational purposes only and should not be used for cheating or academic dishonesty.
- The solution provided may not be the only or the best way to solve the lab.
- The solution is based on the Performance Lab provided by the Professor, the solution may not work with different versions or variations of the lab.
