# Architecture Lab

This repository contains the solution for the Architecture Lab of a computer organization class. The Architecture Lab is a hands-on exercise in which the goal is to understand the architecture and design of computer systems by building and experimenting with different components.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Architecture Lab is to give students a deeper understanding of how computer systems work by building and experimenting with different components, such as processors, memory, and communication buses. Through the lab, I gained a deeper understanding of the design trade-offs and constraints that engineers must consider when building computer systems. Especially when dealing with the hcl files, it feels like we found the bottom of this computer architecture hole.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the architecture lab directory.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the lab manual to build and experiment with different components of a computer system.
3. Use the provided tools and software to analyze and evaluate the performance of the system.
4. Write a report on the results and observations from the lab.

## Tools and Resources

- Logic analyzer
- Oscilloscope
- Microcontroller board
- Assembly and C programming
- Data analysis tools
