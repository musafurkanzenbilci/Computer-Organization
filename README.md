# Computer Organization

This repository contains solutions for various computer organization lab assignments, including bomblab, attacklab, architecture lab, and performance lab. The solutions are provided for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial purposes.

## Bomblab

This solution demonstrates the use of reverse engineering techniques to disarm a virtual "binary bomb" by analyzing its assembly code and determining the input required to defuse each phase.

## Attacklab

This solution demonstrates the use of buffer overflow and return-oriented programming attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in a virtual machine.

## Architecture Lab

This solution demonstrates the implementation of different computer architectures and their performance characteristics.

## Performance Lab

This solution demonstrates the implementation of different performance optimization techniques, such as cache optimization and branch prediction.
